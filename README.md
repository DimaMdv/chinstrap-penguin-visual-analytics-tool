# The dataset

**Title of the dataset:** GPS tracks of chinstrap penguins at the South Orkney Islands, 2011-2019

**Dimensions:** 325x20 on the metadata table and ~1000x3 for GPS tracks of individuals.

**Attributes:**

- *Metadata:* Dep_ID, Location, Species, Date_deployed, Time_deployed, Date_retreived, Time_retreived, GPS, TDR, Bill_length [mm], Bill_depth [mm], Weight_deployment [kg], Weight_return [kg], Sex, Stage [a], Nest_on_dep [b], Nest_on_return, Notes, Nest_lat [deg N], Nest_lon [deg E].

- *GPS tracks:* DateTime, Latitude_degrees_north, Longitude_degrees_east.

**Description:** The data comprises of GPS tracks for chinstrap penguins, pygoscelid antarcticus, at the South Orkney Islands (Signy, Monroe, Powell and Laurie island) from 2011 to 2019. The dataset consists mainly of two parts. First, there is a "metadata" table detailing dates nd conditions of penguins upon attaching and retrieving GPS trackers. Secondly, there are tables of time-series of coordinates of individuals, separated by island they have been tagged on.
